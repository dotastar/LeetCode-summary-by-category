	 * Given an integer array, adjust each integers so that the difference of
	 * every adjcent integers are not greater than a given number target.
	 * If the array before adjustment is A, the array after adjustment is B, you
	 * should minimize the sum of |A[i]-B[i]|
	 * 
	 * Note You can assume each number in the array is a positive integer and
	 * not greater than 100
	 * 
	 * Example 
	 * Given [1,4,2,3] and target=1, one of the solutions is [2,3,2,3],
	 * the adjustment cost is 2 and it's minimal. Return 2.
